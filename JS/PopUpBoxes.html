        <p>In JavaScript, there are three types of popup boxes: alert, confirm, and prompt.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Alert Box
                <ul>
                    <li>An alert box in JavaScript is a popup window that displays a simple message to the user. It is triggered by the alert() function and pauses code execution 
                        until the user clicks the “OK” button to close it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prompt Box
                <ul>
                    <li>A prompt box in JavaScript is a popup window that asks the user for input. It is triggered by the prompt() function, which displays a message and input field, 
                        allowing the user to provide a response or cancel.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Confirm Box
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or permission from the user. 
                        The user has to press the OK or Cancel button to proceed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        
        <script>
            let name = prompt("Enter your name:");
            if(name){
                let c=confirm("Press OK to confirm");
                if(c==true){
                    alert("You have entered the name");
                }
                else{
                    alert("You cancelled the confirmation");
                }
            }
            else{
                alert("Please enter your name");
            }
